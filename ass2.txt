1.  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The main purpose of HTML is to add structure to the web page. 
    It is a standard language for creating web pages. It allows the structure of sections, paragraphs, headers, etc. 

2.  HTML elements hold and specify the general content while HTML attributes are used to describe the characteristics 
    of an HTML in detail. Examples of  HTML elements are <p></p> and <h1></h1>. Examples of HTML attributes are sr,  alt, width, height, etc.

3.  DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction that tells the browser what HTML version the document is written in. 
    If it is omitted the browser won't be able to interpret the document correctly, the browser is forced to enter into a quirks mode.

4.  An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary while a 
    block-level element always starts a new line and takes up the full width available. Examples of inline elements are 
    <a>, <span> and <img>. Examples of block elements are <p> and <div>.

5.  The <head> tag is a container for metadata and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    
    The <div> tag is the container for flow content. it defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    
    The <a> tag is an anchor element which defines an hyperlink,which is used to link from one page to another.
    
    The <img> tag is an image element used to embed an image in an HTML page. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

    <ul> defines an unordered list,  It is used to make a list in those situations where the ordering of list items is not significant.

    <ol> is to create an ordered list. 

    <li> HTML element is used to represent an item in a list.

6.  Semantic HTML elements clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer.examples of 
    semantic elements are <article>, <main>, <section> and <form>. Semantic elements help search engines to understand 
    the topic, purpose, and meaning of a web page, by using tags that describe the type and hierarchy of the content, 
    such as <title>, <meta>, <h1> to <h6>, etc.

7.  An HTML form is used to collect user input after which the user input is most often sent to a server for 
    processing. Controls are objects that display data or make it easier for users to enter or edit data, perform an 
    action, or make a selection. Examples of common HTML controls include <input>, <textarea> and <select>.

8.  Comments is added to HTML document by starting with <!-- and ending with â€“ >. Comments make a code more 
    understandable and they are an essential part for developers to add notes and explanations to their code.

9.  HTML 5 is a foundational language for web development and is supported by all modern web browsers. The new 
    features that are introduced include semantic elements, responsive images, local storage, audio and video supports, canvas elements, etc.

10. A responsive web design automatically adjusts for different-sized screens and viewports. With a responsive 
    website, someone can browse your website from any device and it will still look and function perfectly. 
    Fundamentally, HTML is responsive, or fluid. If a web page is created containing only HTML, with no CSS, 
    and you resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport.
